# Dev environment

This template provides basic configuration to quickly start developing.

## Requirements

To take full advantage of this template, you will need to install the following tools:

- **Docker**: https://www.docker.com/
- **SBT**: https://www.scala-sbt.org/

## Start the development environment

Before developing, you just have to start the dependencies (databases, message queue, etc.) with Docker Compose.

```bash
cd /path/to/microservice
docker compose up -d
```

## Run the microservice

Use SBT CLI to fetch libraries and run the microservice.

```bash
cd /path/to/microservice
sbt run
```

## Stop the development environment

Once you finished your work, just stop the dependencies.

```bash
cd /path/to/microservice
docker compose down
```
