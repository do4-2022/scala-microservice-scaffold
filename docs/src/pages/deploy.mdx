# Deploy

## Build a Docker image

> These steps require [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) to be installed on your computer.

First you need to build a Docker image of your microservice.

```bash
cd /path/to/microservice
docker build -t dockerusername/your-microservice:version .
```

Don't forget to replace `dockerusername`, `yourmicroservice` and `version` by you [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/) username, your microservice name and its version respectively.

## Deploy with Terraform

> These steps require [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) to be installed on your computer.

Once you have a Docker image of your microservice, you can use Terraform to deploy it with all its dependencies (databases, message queue, etc.).

1. Copy `terraform/env-example.tfvars` to `terraform/env.tfvars`.

```bash
cd /path/to/microservice/terraform
cp env-example.tfvars env.tfvars
```

2. Change deployment variables in `terraform/env.tfvars` as you need (don't forget to change **app_docker_image**).

3. Deploy your microservice.

```bash
terraform init
terraform apply -var-file="env.tfvars"
```
