## Features

### Preselected libraries

We wrote for you tiny wrappers around well-known scala libraries. Our goal was to use ZIO as much as possible.
You will also find examples using these libraries when starting with this template.

- **HTTP Server**: A wrapper around [zio-http](https://zio.dev/zio-http/).
- **SQL ORM**: A wrapper around [zio-sql](https://zio.dev/zio-sql/).
- **Message Queue**: A wrapper around [zio-amqp](https://github.com/svroonland/zio-amqp).

### Ops configurations

- **Dockerfile**: To build an image of your microservice.
- **docker-compose.yaml**: To run dependencies and quickly start to code without installing databases or messages queues.
- **terraform** (folder): Containing Terraform configurations to make deployment easy.
