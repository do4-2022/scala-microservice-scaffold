# Using the HTTP Server

The HTTP server provides some basic routes. You can use them as is or extend them to fit your needs.

## Set up

To run the HTTP server, only environment variables are needed. You can set them up in your terminal as follows:

```bash
export HTTP_SERVER_PORT=8080;
export JWT_SECRET=secretKey;
```

> Note : The default values are the ones used in the example above. You can run the server without setting any environment variables.
